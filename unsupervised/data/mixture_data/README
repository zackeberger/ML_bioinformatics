This directory contains two datasets:

1.mixture1.*
Contains data from a mixture model with 2 components (i.e. populations)

mixture1.geno contains genoytpes for 1000 haploid individuals at 5000 SNPs (5000 rows and 1000 columns)
mixture1.alpha is the mixture proportion (pi for each population)
mixture1.freq is the allele frequency in each of the two populations (f; rows = number of SNPs, columns = number of populations)
mixture1.ganc indicates which population each individual belongs to (z; rows = number of individuals, columns = number of populations)


Use this data to test your implementation.

2. mixture2.geno contains the genotype data for 1000 individuals at 5000 SNPs
